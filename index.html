            <div>Thomas Edisons was an inventor. His workshop in Menlo Park NJ, now Edison NJ, gave birth to a multitude
                of the inventions we in the 21st century take for granted; most influental of wich is the incandescent
                lightbulb.

                When information was first being shared to the public about the lightbulb there was a decent amount of
                convincing that still had to be done. <a href="/sources/#[1]">[1]</a> Newspapers were used to flaunt the
                cheap price, that it would “cost not more than 25 cents.” in comparrison to the gas lamps of the day and
                explain the how the bulb functions.

                This is one of Edisons origional light bulbs, now on display at the Smithsonian's National Museum of
                American History you can see the vital part that had made this invention possible, the carbon filament,
                had
                broken over time.

                Edison would file a pattent for his first major lamp breakthrough lamp in 1878 for a platnum filament
                lamp. This lamp was succesful but did not catch on due to its energy inneficency and amount of light it
                produced.
                This first proof of
                concept comes meerley a year before his carbon filament lamp, having said “All the problems which have
                been
                puzzling me for the last 18 months have been solved” <a href="/sources/#[1]">[1]</a> for a newspaper
                article.
