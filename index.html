Dear Madame
Your favor of the 19th was duly rec'd -  The megaphone is not yet completed and I am quite unable to say when it will be as at present I am busily engaged on the Electric light.
Very Truly

                <span style="font-style: italic;"> Thomas Edison </span> was an inventor. His workshop in Menlo Park NJ,
                now Edison NJ, gave
                birth to
                a
                multitude
                of the inventions we in the 21st century take for granted; most influential of which is the
                incandescent
                lightbulb.

                Born on February 11, 1847, Thomas Edison would become the single most influential inventor of his time.
                By 1882 he had ushered in the age of electricity by creating the first commercial power
                station to sell electricity and lights to those living nearby in Manhattan, creating the market for his
                products. Edison's electric companies would later come together to become Edison's General Electric and
                after more mergers, just General Electric. Edison would die in 1931 at the age of 84.

                When information was first being shared to the public about the lightbulb there was a decent amount of
                convincing that still had to be done. <a href="/sources/#[S1]">[S1]</a> Newspapers were used to flaunt
                the
                cheap price, that it would “cost not more than 25 cents.” and be "cheaper then oil" <a

                This is one of Edison original light bulbs, now on display at the Smithsonian's National Museum of
                American History you can see the vital part that had made this invention possible, the carbon filament,
                had
                broken over time.

                Edison would file a patent for his first major lamp breakthrough lamp in 1878 for a platinum filament
                lamp.<a href="/sources/#[O2]">[O2]</a> This lamp
                was successful but did not catch on due to its energy inefficiency, low amount of light it
                produced and unnatural cool tone.
                This first proof of
                concept comes merely a year before his carbon filament lamp, having said “All the problems which have
                been
                puzzling me for the last 18 months have been solved” <a href="/sources/#[S1]">[S1]</a> for a newspaper
                article.

                <a href="/sources/#[S1]">[S1]</a> The power efficiency of the carbon bulb was heavily stressed, pushing
                to
                the potential customers that both the bulbs and wiring were cheap. The price of the carbon bulb compared
                to the platinum bulb, and especially gas lamps was much lower. With this lower price of the bulb, the
                price to run electric cables was also significantly cheaper then the price of pipes, and since the
                cables used were the same as telegraph wire, people would have been more familiar with the price and
                ease of running.

                <a href="/sources/#[S2]">[S2]</a>By the invention of the light bulb, the gas industry had already
                created large sprawling and built out
                pipelines and grids for their gas lamps in cities. $1,500,000,000 had been spent on gas infrastructure
                by 1879. By 1910 there had been “about the amount of the electric-lighting investment in the United
                States.” as there had been gas investment in 1879.
