Dear Madame
Your favor of the 19th was duly rec'd -  The megaphone is not yet completed and I am quite unable to say when it will be as at present I am busily engaged on the Electric light.
Very Truly

                <span style="font-style: italic;"> Thomas Edison </span> was an inventor. His workshop in Menlo Park NJ,
                now Edison NJ, gave
                birth to
                a
                multitude
                of the inventions we in the 21st century take for granted; most influential of which is the
                incandescent
                lightbulb.

                When information was first being shared to the public about the lightbulb there was a decent amount of
                convincing that still had to be done. <a href="/sources/#[1]">[1]</a> Newspapers were used to flaunt the
                cheap price, that it would “cost not more than 25 cents.” in comparison to the gas lamps of the day and
                explain the how the bulb functions.

                This is one of Edison original light bulbs, now on display at the Smithsonian's National Museum of
                American History you can see the vital part that had made this invention possible, the carbon filament,
                had
                broken over time.

                Edison would file a patent for his first major lamp breakthrough lamp in 1878 for a platinum filament
                lamp. This lamp
                was successful but did not catch on due to its energy inefficiency and amount of light it
                produced.
                This first proof of
                concept comes merely a year before his carbon filament lamp, having said “All the problems which have
                been
                puzzling me for the last 18 months have been solved” <a href="/sources/#[1]">[1]</a> for a newspaper
                article.

                <a href="/sources/#[1]">[1]</a> The power efficiency of the carbon bulb was heavily stressed, pushing to
                the potential customers that both the bulbs and wiring were cheap. The price of the carbon bulb compared
                to the platinum bulb, and especially gas lamps was much lower. With this lower price of the bulb, the
                price to run electric cables was also significantly cheaper then the price of pipes, and since the
                cables used were the same as telegraph wire, people would have been more familiar with the price and
                ease of running
