                        I wanted to make my project on Thomas Edison because since this is the longest i have been away
                        from the state I wanted to be able to do something that I was raised knowing about but probably
                        not many
                        other people,especially if not from NJ and also I was a little homesick when I chose the topic
                        so it made me feel better.
                    </li>
